"BANIMES             ","Animal Messenger by Regula Meyer                                                                                        ","We each feel connections to animals in our own way. Some of us have pets. Others admire animals in the wild. Because the outer world often reflects our internal states and animals are highly sensitive to our energies, each encounter with an animal signals something about our inner world and innermost concerns. The spontaneous, surprising contacts are the telling ones: a sparrow landing next to you, a fox darting across the road, or a bee alighting on your hand. However, even regular encounters with our pets can draw attention to our inner world and what needs to be thought over and grappled with, from psychic turmoil and relationship issues to spiritual growth and the deepest needs of the soul.   Providing sophisticated psychological insight into encounters with more than 150 animals, birds, reptiles, insects, and aquatic life, Regula Meyer explores the messages each animal provides for us on a personal level when we encounter them. She explains how the meaning of each encounter depends on whether the animal was hunting, fleeing, hiding, or acting indifferent when sighted. For example, a fleeing animal is prompting you to pursue a subject consciously, while a hiding animal tells you to patiently observe something and draw insights from it.   The author shows how animal encounters in the wild cause us to contemplate the present moment and inspire the flow of our perceptions, leading us to meditate on important concerns we may be ignoring or unaware of. Pets and other animals we see every day act as intensifiers of the energy for which they stand.   With this animal-by-animal guide, you can discover the deep meaning behind your encounters with animals and the messages they bring as oracles of our souls.","15","1.3","18",,0,"BANIMES.jpg                              ",0

When an animal, insect, bird, or other creature from nature appears repetitively, whether in real life or dreams, it is time to pay attention and find the message that nature is bringing you. There are many teachings available to us through the observation of a particular animal totem and their habits and patterns. For example, parrot medicine can teach us to see life from another perspective as we mimic the wise ones who have walked on the path before us. Mouse medicine teaches us to scrutinize all the details before taking action. Bear may teach you to go within yourself to find answers within your personal cave. Every animal is an ally, and every animal has a story to help you find inner peace, knowledge, and wisdom. The associated gemstone for each animal totem is a further indication of the energy of the animal as symbolism and a teaching on your sacred journey. Crystals, minerals, and stones hold the history of the Earth and all this planet has to offer you to evolve your soul and spirit in this incarnation. The color, formation, and the manner in which the stone grows in the Earth offers a teaching to know yourself and your life purpose. It takes time and inner reflection to understand the messages and clues throughout the gemstone kingdom. Matching the teachings of animals with the teachings of gemstones, Margaret Ann Lembo shows how there is symbolism in all around offering clues to light your path. Exploring 88 gems, stones, and crystals and 88 different animal allies, she details the spiritual connections of crystal vibrations and animal medicine, providing you with a deeper understanding of the interconnected energies of everything around us. She shows how the spiritual fulfillment you seek is available to you in so many ways and this path of working with gemstones and animal medicine is just one of many.

The imminent rebirth of a peaceful, balanced, connected world was predicted in Norse mythology as the return of Baldr, the gentle and compassionate Nordic god of truth, healing, and rune work. Illustrating ecstatic trance postures to connect with the ancient Nordic people and their beliefs, to journey to exact points in time, and to access specific powers, such as seeing into our future, Brink explores humanity’s evolving cycle of consciousness from the era when the Great Mother goddess was the center of life through the transition to the worship of power and physical strength in the Bronze Age and the world of the Vikings. He explores the coming return of Baldr and the imminent new age of peace and respect for the earth. Through hypnotic divination, the author expands the stories of the early Nordic gods and goddesses from the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, in particular the fertility deities of the Vanir, such as Freyr, Freyja, and Idunn, who came before the warrior deities of the Æsir, such as Odin, Thor, and Loki. He details the epic battle of Ragnarok and the birth, life, death, and rebirth of Baldr. Brink shows how these ancient stories happen outside of time, in the past, present, and future, thus Baldr’s return is replayed in our death-rebirth experiences of life, in each dawn, with each spring, and now with the birth of a new age that we see happening all around us. Through the power of trance at this time of rebirth, we move full circle to reclaim the magic of the earliest times, the times of the Garden of Idunn.","2","1.3","18",10/11/2019 0:00:00,0,"BBALMAG.jpg                              ",0

Touching on both white and black magical practices, he explains the basic principles of medieval magic, including the doctrine of names and signatures, mastery of the power of images, and the laws of sympathy and contagion. He gives an overview of magic in the Western Mystery tradition, emphasizing both lesser-known magicians such as Trithemus and Peter of Apono and famous ones like Albertus Magnus and Hermes Trismegistus. Creating a universal grimoire, Lecouteux provides exact reproductions of secret magical alphabets, symbols, and glyphs with instructions for their use as well as an illustrated collection of annotated spells, rituals, and talismans for numerous applications including amorous magic, healing magic, and protection rites.

The process is deceptively simple--first you must recognize your own responsibility for creating the events in your life, then you are ready to apply the mantra of Ho'oponopono: I’m sorry, Forgive me, Thank you, I love you. Repeated several times over a dedicated interval, the negativity is replaced with inner peace, love, and harmony--and, as the stories in this book show, sometimes even miracles take place. In this step-by-step guide, the authors explain how to apply Ho'oponopono to traumatic past events, destructive thought patterns, family dynamics, daily annoyances, or any other disagreeable event in your life, from traffic jams to relationship break-ups. Drawing on quantum physics and epigenetics, they explore how Ho'oponopono works--how thoughts and consciousness can affect the expression of your DNA, the materialization of your goals, and the behavior of those around you. They explain how negative thought patterns and memories unconsciously guide your life and draw more negativity to you, perpetuating the cycle of bad events and clouding your recollection of the past. By apologizing to yourself, your memory, and the event in question, you can forgive yourself, heal your memories, and cleanse your perceptions. By reconciling with yourself, you open your heart to love for your experiences, yourself, and others and bring harmony to your mind, body, and the world around you.","14","0.6","14.95",,0,"BBOOHOO.jpg                              ",0

Drawing on theories first pioneered by the Swedish scholar Sigurd Agrell (1881-1937), he reveals the genesis of the Tarot’s symbolism in the great Hermetic tradition at the same time the Magical Papyri were being written in Greco-Roman Egypt. He explains how the sequencing of the Major Arcana is related to the images used in Mithraic initiation, elements of which were then integrated into existing Roman and Egyptian traditions. Exploring the Magian teachings on the Stoeicheia, an alphabet that acted as a map for understanding the order of the cosmos, he demonstrates how this alphabet of magical symbols was the template for the Tarot. The author also shows how the 22 Major Arcana cards were related to the 22 letters of the Roman alphabet used for oracular purposes in ancient times. Looking in-depth at the principles of Mithraism, the author explains how the Roman form of Mithraism, a guiding factor in the early shaping of the Tarot, was itself a synthesis of Iranian Magianism, Greek stoicism, Babylonian astrology, and Greco-Egyptian Hermeticism. Exploring the cards themselves, Flowers then looks at the original meanings of the Major Arcana using Mithraic symbolism and its offshoots. He also explains the truth behind many of the myths surrounding the Tarot, including their deep-level connections with Egypt, the Romani people, the Semitic tradition, and runes. By restoring the original mysteria to the icons of the Tarot and learning their true origins, we can better understand the insight these powerful cards impart in divination.

The Moon circles the Earth and zodiac in approximately 28 days and changing signs every 2½ days. The Moon sets the tone of the day. When we know today’s Moon sign, we know what to expect of the public mood and how to easily handle people. When we know the Moon we were born under, we have a new understanding of ourselves, what drives us, and what makes us feel at home. And when we know the Moon sign of our partner, boss or best friend, we have a beneficial tool to understand and get along smoothly with them. In Part I of Moon Wisdom each sign of the zodiac is divided into two sections, focusing on the Moon by the day and by the person. First the meaning and usefulness of the sign of the Moon each calendar day is explored to help us navigate our day and make the most of our time. Then the imprint of that sign and phase of the Moon at the moment of our birth is explored to better understand and deal effectively with ourselves and others. In Part II the exploration goes deeper as we layer in the effect of the phases of the Moon on our everyday life and on our birth Moon. From here we bring attention to the Moon’s relationship to the other planets, and how to use those important aspect-relationships to fine tune our planning. Heather Roan Robbins shows how with the wisdom of the moon and its empowering guidance you can always choose your response and take charge of your life in a positive, healthy, and proactive way!","0","1.1","19.95",,0,"BMOOWIS.jpg                              ",0

Many people know that the Norse gods fought against giants and were ultimately betrayed by Loki the trickster. The end of the world and the death of the gods in a grim battle called Ragnarok has also found its way into popular culture. Ideas taken from Norse mythology are frequently found in modern fantasy and science fiction – such as elves, dwarfs and undead warriors rising from an unquiet grave, for example. Norse mythology is rich in adventure and ideas about creation, death and the afterlife. Norse Myths takes a wide-ranging approach, examining the creation stories of the Norse world, the monsters and the pantheons of the deities, including such figures as Heimdall, Freya and Baldr. It looks at the sagas and the Prose and Poetic Eddas, which tell of real and imagined people, featuring both heroic tales and humorous escapades. The book also examines how Norse myths were interpreted in a Christianized Europe and how their motifs influenced medieval German writers and, in turn, were used in the modern world in very different ways, by the likes of composer Richard Wagner and in the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. Illustrated with 180 color and black &amp; white artworks and illustrations, Norse Myths is an engaging and highly informative exploration of a rich mythology that still resounds today.","5","2.2","29.95",,0,"BNORMYT.jpg                              ",0

He explores the belief in three different types of witches: white witches, who offer help and healing for a fee; black witches, who harm others; and gray witches, who practice both white and black magic. Examining witchcraft’s contentious relationship with the Christian church, he investigates the persecution of witches throughout the UK and the British West Indies up until the mid-20th century.

It also includes material on astronomy, astrology, gematria, and various magical talismans, most notably those used for protection during childbirth.

It has continued to sell for decades. And no wonder. Up until the time this book was published, very little information about true high magic was available to the public. In this book, Regardie reveals the secrets of real magic. He begins with an explanation of what magic is and, just as importantly, what magic is not. He explains that it is a spiritual study and practice which, along with forms of yoga, forms the two branches of the tree that is mysticism. Magic is not being a medium or a psychic. Then he explains the tools of the magician, what they mean, and how to use them. He explains the techniques of evocation and invocation, scrying, and astral travel. He shows how the Qabalah unites everything. He even gives a description of the secrets of sexual magick. All of this is in a clear, lucid writing style. This book is simply a must for anyone who is, or aspires to be, a real magician. Although Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero were friends of Regardie and are Senior Adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, what changes could they have made to this classic book? Well, they did change the spelling from British style to American. And they did change his transliterations of Hebrew into the more popular style he used in his later books. But nothing vital was changed or removed. Everything else they added was complementary to the text that was there. And what incredible additions they are! Extensive annotations throughout every chapter; over 100 illustrations; more descriptive contents pages; a glossary, a bibliography and an index. They've even added a biographical note on Regardie and the importance of this book to him and to the occult world. This book contains some of the finest occult writing that has ever been produced. And with the new material by the Ciceros, it becomes a must-have for any magician! Paperback English | 552 pages | 6 x 9 x 1"".","3","1.8","26.99",,1,"BTRELIF.jpg                              ",0

The author’s premise is that, beginning in the 1980s, with the rise of modern metaphysical publishing, authors began presenting very personal witchcraft practices. In the process, traditional and formerly well-established practices fell into obscurity, which potentially lead to confusion. What We Knew in the Night uncovers and clarifies those buried gems for a new generation, assembling and integrating key components of witchcraft, past and present. Grimassi lays out key mystical and practical foundations of witchcraft and restores their important role.","20","1.1","21.95",,0,"BWHAWE.jpg                               ",0

Court astrologer to Elizabeth I, he devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy, divination and Hermetic philosophy. Dee considered all his activities to be different facets of the same quest for an understanding of the divine forms he saw as underlying the visible world, and which showed themselves as oracles—words of wisdom from angelic sources. Now best-selling author John Matthews and award-winning artist Wil Kinghan have transformed Dee’s studies into The Oracle of Dr. John Dee. Drawing together the interrelated aspects of Dee’s work, this oracle offers guidance on key life areas in your own quest or life journey. Based on Dee’s own Golden Talisman (currently held in the British Museum), the oracle is governed by the Four Towers of the talisman on which the cards are laid, each representing one of four key divisions of life: health, love, work and intention. Each tower is ruled over by a mighty archangel, who brings the appropriate wisdom, understanding, healing or insight to the issue at hand, helping you to find the way through the storms of life offering strength, support and inspiration.","15","1.1","19.95",,0,"DORADR.jpg                               ",0

This is where some believe it even gets its name, referring to its ability to ""trip up the devil,"" as if you tied his shoe laces together. Tied together as an anklet, Devil`s Shoestring is also known to be of particular help in preventing the wearer from being poisoned by Goofer`s dust. Other uses within such spiritual practice also involve the herb aiding finding good luck, helping to find a new job or a raise, achieving invisibility, or acquiring some measure of control over the opposite sex. Today, Devil`s Shoestring is still most commonly identified with this old Hoodoo and Root Magic practices that are, if anything, more widespread and common today than ever. Outside of this, some medicinal use has also been found by some Herbalists. These Herbalists see it as an antispasmodic, particularly in helping to ease menstrual pains. This is a 1lb bag of Devil`s Shoestring.","140","5.5","215.95",,0,"HDEVSRB.jpg                              ",0

Shea butter provides all essential vitamins needed to make the skin look and feel smoother, softer and most importantly healthier. Its therapeutic properties protect the skin from wind, cold, & sun and it helps heal wounds faster. Shea butter stimulates cellular activity, fights the effects of aging and repairs rough, damaged skin. When pure and unrefined, it has a yellowish texture and gives out a nutty fragrance. Shea butter is most extensively used all over the world for its proven moisturizing and healing properties.
